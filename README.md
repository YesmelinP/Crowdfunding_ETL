# Crowdfunding_ETL
Project 2 (Extract, transform, load)

## Overview
This repository contains the code for Project 2, where we performed data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL). This process is crucial for data analysis as it improves data quality, reliability, and ease of analysis. For this project, we integrated two data sources: the contacts and crowdfunding Excel files. The data was consolidated into a PostgreSQL database containing four tables: campaign, contacts, category, and subcategory.
